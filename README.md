# Calculatin-Web
A simple calculator, made with HTML, CSS and JS. This is my first project.
I built this web calculator following an online tutorial available here: https://dev.to/javascriptacademy/create-a-simple-calculator-using-html-css-and-javascript-4o7k .
The web calculator is deployed on Netlify, you can give it a try here: https://calculatin.netlify.app/
